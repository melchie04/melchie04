# Hi, I am Melchor Callos
I work as a software tester specializing in automation testing, and I also have expertise in whitebox and functional testing. My passion for programming drives me to continually enhance my skills, and I find great fulfillment in developing websites. This not only allows me to improve my programming abilities but also brings a sense of accomplishment as I create functional and user-friendly web solutions.

ðŸŒ± I am currently working with Selenium Java.

âš¡ Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C#.
